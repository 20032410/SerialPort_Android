"SerialPort Android" is a library which goals is to improve and add ease of access to serial devices and USB<>RS232 devices under Android OS.
It's goal is to provide a huge unification of several serial chip providers under a single, easy to use class/object.

We plan into having no need to root Android's devices and to be able to target as much as SDK versions as possible.
Currently we support from API 13 to API 17 (tests are under in progress with API 18).
Meaning we support from Android 3.2 to Android 4.2.2.

#todo (by priority and possibility)#
* Add support to prolific devices.
* Improve unification of serial device.
* Add automatic class instantiation; including finding the serials ports and returning back the final usable object.
* Add support to several others devices/manufacturers.
